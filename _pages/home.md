I am a postdoc at the University of Iceland. My primary interest is for the understanding of meso and submesoscale structures in the ocean. I am currently working on the characterization of these structures around Iceland. This work is done under a Queen Margrethe’s and Vigdís Finnbogadóttir's fellowship in collaboration with Angel Ruiz-Angulo.
